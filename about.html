    <p> Wolfgang Woodcock is a composer and multi-instrumentalist based in Los Angeles, CA, who focuses on aleatoric and improvisatory composition. These compositions range from experimental scores for animated and live action films, to chamber ensemble pieces and songs. Woodcock has premiered his works at venues such as the Roy O. Disney Hall, Art Share LA, and the Herb and Lani Alpert Hall. He most recently scored the upcoming web-series The L Train using some of the improvisatory techniques he has been cultivating over the past few years. He has studied under composers Laura Steenberge, Marc Lowenstein, and Kevin Kelly. As a performer, Woodcock has mainly worked as an electric bass player and has traveled extensively throughout the US and Europe. He has performed alongside Jenny Lee Lindberg of Warpaint and his own project, VS Colour. These projects have held residencies at Los Angeles venues The Echoplex, The Hi Hat, and Civic Center Studios. Recently, he has started to perform new music pieces by composers like Phil Niblock and Sean Hayward.
